How It Works.

- Connects To VPS/RDP
- Sends Commands To VPS/RDP

This Sends Commands To Servers To Protect Your Sources
E.G - Sends User File To VPS, Obfuscates User File, Returns Obfuscated File
This Way Users Cant Crack Obfuscator Sources Or Whatever You Need It For

Client IS Used For The User (Main Loader)
Please Obfuscate Cor Dll And Client Exe
